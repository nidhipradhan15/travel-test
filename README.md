# Wanderlust — Curated Journeys

A single-page website for a travel agency, built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Contents

- **index.html** — Structure and content (hero, destinations, experiences, about, contact)
- **styles.css** — Layout, typography (Cormorant Garamond, Outfit), and responsive design
- **script.js** — Header scroll effect, mobile menu, contact form feedback

## Run locally

Open `index.html` in a browser, or use a local static server:

```bash
# Python
python3 -m http.server 8000

# Node (npx)
npx serve
```

Then visit `http://localhost:8000` (or the port shown).

## Push to GitHub

1. Create a new repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/new) (e.g. name: `heyjobs` or `wanderlust-travel`). Do **not** add a README, .gitignore, or license (this repo already has them).
2. In this folder, add the remote and push:

```bash
cd /Users/kashish/Desktop/heyjobs
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` and `YOUR_REPO_NAME` with your GitHub username and repo name.

Description:
 Wanderlust is your digital compass to the world’s most hidden corners. We believe that travel isn’t just about the destination; it’s about the stories you bring home and the perspective you gain along the way. From misty mountain peaks to the quiet hum of a cobblestone street at dawn, we provide the inspiration you need to stop dreaming and start exploring.
